I am a PhD student based in the Machine Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://samuelalbanie.com/">Samuel Albanie</a> (Google DeepMind), <a href="https://www.kaihan.org/">Kai Han</a> (The University of Hong Kong), and <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/efs20/">Emily Shuckburgh</a> (University of Cambridge). I am part of the Application of Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risk (<a href="https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/">AI4ER</a>) CDT.

My research interests include evaluating, benchmarking and understanding the behaviour and capabilities of vision-language models, large language models and large multimodal models. I am particularly interested in the application of these models to the scientific and geospatial domains as well as long-context settings.

Previously, I completed an MRes in Environmental Data Science at the University of Cambridge. Before this, I was a Systems Engineer at Lockheed Martin. I initially completed a Master of Physics (BSc MPhys) at the University of Warwick, supervised by <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/people/pollacco/">Don Pollacco</a> and <a href="https://mpolin.com/">Marco Polin</a>.
